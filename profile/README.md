# Unhinged Tiny Devs
We are a small indie team working on our first project 'Blood and Wit' a tactical turn based rouge-like. Our inspration is drawn from games like Final Fantasy Tactics: war of the lions, Triangle Stragety, Fire Emblem, Hades, Risk of Rain and others. This is a passion project and we will see where it leads us. If you are intrested in following along on the progress you can check out our Discord, YouTube, or Website.
